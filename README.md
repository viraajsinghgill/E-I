In today's fast-paced world, events and internships are critical for personal and professional growth. The goal of the E&I application is to provide a platform where users can easily find and post events and internships. There are a few existing solutions in the market, but they are often cluttered and difficult to navigate.

Our application is built with a user-centric design in mind, providing a seamless experience for users to browse, post, and connect with others. The application supports dark mode and light mode to make it comfortable for users to use the application for extended periods.
